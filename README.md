## How We Built It

The development journey began with a clear purposeâ€”creating a user-friendly platform. We implemented smart contracts using the ERC721 standard, integrating Frax Testnet's privacy features for confidential transactions. The UI/Contract frontend was carefully designed to ensure a seamless and engaging interaction for users.

## Challenges We Ran Into

Axios network errors during image loading and transitioning from ERC20 to ERC721 presented initial challenges. Testing and debugging the smart contract added complexity, and time constraints were a constant factor. However, these challenges fueled our determination to deliver a robust solution.

## Accomplishments That We're Proud Of

Successfully overcoming the hurdles and delivering a functional MVP within the hackathon timeframe is a significant achievement. The integration of privacy features, the implementation of a bidding system, and the overall user experience are accomplishments we take pride in.

## What We Learned

The development process provided valuable insights into smart contracts, ERC721 standards, and the nuances of the Frax Testnet. Learning to navigate challenges, from image loading issues to adapting to a new token standard, enhanced our skills in blockchain development.

## What's Next for FrxRise

Looking ahead, FrxRise aims to refine and expand its features. We plan to enhance privacy measures, optimize for scalability, and explore further interoperability with other blockchain networks. The journey continues as we strive to make FrxRise a cornerstone in the decentralized finance landscape.

We will provide users with the ability to upload their vouchers using "IPFS" in the dApp.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
